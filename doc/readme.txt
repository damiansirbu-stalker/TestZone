xlibs: https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/xlibs-1001

Features:
Watcher - monitors all 162 engine callbacks with fire counts and payload logging
Deep introspection - extracts detailed info from tables and userdata arguments
Rate limiting - prevents log spam from high-frequency callbacks
Per-callback toggles - enable/disable individual callbacks via MCM
Periodic statistics - logs top-firing callbacks at configurable intervals

Requirements:
Anomaly 1.5.3
Modded exes: themrdemonized or AOEngine v0.55 or newer. The full feature set needs the latest demonized build; a feature that needs a newer one stays inactive on older exes.
xlibs (https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/xlibs-1001)
MCM

Install (MO2):
1. Install xlibs (load first)
2. Install TestZone
3. Load order does not matter
4. Configure via MCM (Options -> TestZone)

Uninstall (MO2):
Disable or remove in MO2.

Configuration:
Main tab:
  Watcher enabled - master toggle for callback logging
  Periodic statistics - log callback fire counts at regular intervals
  Stats interval - how often to log periodic stats (10-3600 seconds)
  Log payload - log callback arguments (can create large log files)
  Deep introspection - extract detailed info from objects
  Table depth - recursion depth for table introspection (1-4)
  Rate limiting - throttle repeated callback logs
  Rate limit interval - min ms between same callback logs (100-10000)
Tracked Events tab:
  Per-callback enable/disable toggles for all 162 callbacks

Log output: appdata/logs/testzone.log

Compatibility:
Coexists with everything; no known incompatibilities.

Performance and Infrastructure:
Performance comes first, ahead of any feature. When a feature cannot fit the budget it is reworked, replaced, or removed with an X-Ray engine modification rather than allowed to slow the game.
Built from the X-Ray engine source by reverse engineering, with targeted engine changes of my own for performance, precision, and accuracy.
Heavy work spreads across frames, paced by rate limiters and staggered, deferred queues, with the math to keep cost bounded at any entity count.
A layered validator runs on every change, locally and in CI, and blocks the build on any crash, unsafe engine call, performance regression, style break, failed smoke load, or leaked secret.
Profiled with JitProfiler, an engine-native, scientific profiler.
Timings are worst-case, from a build with no multithreading or optimizations, so yours runs faster.

Diagnostics and reporting:
The Watcher is the diagnostic surface: enable it on the Main tab and it logs callback fire counts and payloads to appdata/logs/testzone.log.
Report at https://github.com/damiansirbu-stalker/TestZone/issues/new/choose or the EFP, Anomaly, and Zona Discord. Include repro steps, engine build, modlist, load order, xray.log, and testzone.log.
